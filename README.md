## Installation

Fastest installation is to clone the repository in a path of your choice:

Clone [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats) and link the folder to `.config/awesome`:

```bash
$ cd ~/.config/

$ git clone https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats.git

$ ln -s awesome-copycats awesome

Link both `rc.lua` and `theme.lua` files (in case you cloned `br1` in `~/github/br1`):

```bash
cd ~/.config/awesome

ln -s ~/github/br1/rc.lua

mkdir -p themes/br1

cd themes/br1

ln -s ~/github/br1/theme.lua
```
